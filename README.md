## What is this?
This is a roguelike video game currently in progress. I'm following along with
the users over at [/r/roguelikedev](https://reddit.com/r/roguelikedev). Unlike
many of them, however, I'm going to be making my own version of the game in C#
on .NET Core, using the excellent [SadConsole](https://sadconsole.com)
library. In addition, I plan to write my own tutorial for C# at the end of this
event, based on the code here.

## Installation Instructions
Since this game is still a work in progress, there aren't any pre-made
executables available yet. However you can still play the game if you have .NET
or Mono installed on your system. The project can be opened in your favourite C#
IDE, or it can be run from the command line using the command:

```
dotnet run -p RLTutorial
```
